		<div class="sixcol">
			<h2>Why is it better than WCF?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>You don't have to decorate your interfaces with ServiceContract and OperationContract
				attributes: every method is a part of the contract.</li>

				<li>You can use overloaded methods, which isn't possible with WCF. Service contracts produce WSDL, which doesn't
				support method overloading (all operations must be uniquely named).</li>

				<li>You can call methods with generic parameters, which is also impossible with WCF. What's worse, these
				constraints cannot be validated at compile-time, so malformed WCF contracts throw exceptions at runtime.</li>

				<li>There is no need to create separate callback contract 
				for the duplex communication&nbsp;&#151; just pass in a delegate as an argument to the remote method, or subscribe
				to a remote event using familiar syntax.</li>

				<li>You are not forced to specify component activation mode using attributes at compile time.
				ZyanComponentHost can be configured to activate any component in a single-call (default) or a singleton mode.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="sixcol last">
			<h2>Why is it better than .NET Remoting?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>You don't have to derive your component from MarshalByRefObject. Any .NET class can be used 
				as a hosted component.</li>

				<li>With the duck typing feature, you can bind a component to an interface it doesn't implement
				(provided that all interface methods are implemented). This way you can make any third-party class 
				remotely callable.</li>

				<li>You can set up custom serialization handlers for data types that aren't serializable.
				This way you can make any third-party class serializable.</li>

				<li>You can query remote components using LINQ, even with projections to anonymous classes. LINQ expressions 
				can be passed as method arguments and returned from remote methods. This feature relies on custom serialization
				handlers mentioned above.</li>

				<li>There is no need for special treatment to use events, everything works just out-of-the box. 
				Subscription to the remote event looks exactly the same as local subscription.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="sixcol">
			<h2>Why is it better than other RPC frameworks?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Zyan is more than just an RPC framework. It is in fact a skeleton for a full-featured application server
				with a built-in authentication, session management, policy injection features, etc.</li>

				<li>Authentication system is fully customizable. You can use integrated Windows authentication (single sign on) 
				or plug in your own authentication provider.</li>

				<li>Session management is also customizable. Fast and slim in-process session manager can be used for
				self-hosted single-process application servers. SqlServer-backed session manager is suitable for 
				multi-process clusters. You can easily create your own session manager by inheriting from the base class
				and overriding a few virtual methods.</li>

				<li>Zyan supports transparent traffic compression (using Deflate or LZF algorithm) and encryption out-of-the-box. 
				Encryption feature doesn't require certificates and is not platform dependent.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="sixcol last">
			<h2>What are other benefits of Zyan?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Managed Extensibility Framework integration (only available for .NET 4.x and Mono 2.10) allows building
				loosely coupled client-server applications. You can set up your application server declaratively using MEF
				attributes and publish it with a Zyan host.</li>

				<li>Client application can use MEF container to access remote services.
				Both client and server can be completely unaware of the communication layer being used.</li>

				<li>Zyan supports wiring distributed Event-Based Components. EBC is an architectural model which reduces 
				dependencies between components. Components in EBC application communicate with each other by means of messages 
				instead of invoking methods.</li>

				<li>Other notable features of Zyan include call interception, deterministic resource cleanup, 
				duplex TCP communication, server-side event filters, session-bound events, OneWay methods support, 
				centralized exception handling, and many more.</li>

			<a href="http://www.risk-partnership.com/" target="_top">International Risk Partnership</a> 
			is an independent consultancy. We're using the Zyan Framework 
			to connect several parts of our suite of Risk Management products together, to give our users maximum 
			flexibility in deployment. We've deployed elements locally, across a LAN and even on Amazon AWS (for 
			instance, connecting from UK to Australia) without issue using TCP duplex connections. </p>
			<p>Of particular interest to us and to our clients is the ability to communicate encrypted 
			data quickly &#150; vital for our line of business. </p>
			<p>Typically we have one or more control applications using duplex TCP to a remote server 
			running our Data Manager. This in turn connects to our Central Logic via IPC. The Central Logic 
			implements a queue and multi-threaded engines thus releasing the Data Manager quickly to prepare 
			the next call.</p>
			<p>In summary we use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Duplex TCP channel for inter-network calls</li>
				<li>A callback registry of clients so we can pass data back and forth 
				between multiple connected clients (and to the correct client!)</li>
				<li>Encryption for safe data transfer.</li>
				<li>IPC binary channel for calls on the same machine, to keep our logical 
				business processes separate and therefore maximise resources, and to get maximum connection speed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Trying to use TCP Remoting without the Zyan Framework would never have got off the ground &#150; 
			just glad we came across it. Also, we have received excellent service and support with even 
			the most inept questions &#150; thanks to you both for this!</p>

			Fire-fighting departments in Germany use Zyan-powered application to control the state
			of the fire-fighting vehicles (sorry, no website yet).</p>
			<p>The software has a client-server architecture. Each fire truck sends analog radio signals to headquaters. 
			These signals are decoded using a third party hardware component at a centralized server. 
			Server gets state through a decoder and sends to all clients. At any client site, the information worker 
			can create a dashboard of all fire trucks he wants to monitor. The following Zyan features are used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Duplex TCP connection between server and clients</li>
				<li>IPC connection between udpate service and server</li>

			We are using Zyan for our Inhouse-Development of an ERP-System. Long time ago we are using a OpenSource ERP, 
			but we have Special Needs and the "old" System wasn't develop again. </p>
			<p>So we start on January 1, 2013. with a new Project. Now in December will will release our first Version 
			to do the inventure. We plan to Change the ERP complete at end of year 2014. Here some Highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Client-Server architecture (Communication with Zyan - TCPDuplex)</li>
				<li>Full .NET development (WPF - MVVM - Entity Framework) - most of the code is written in VB.NET</li>
				<li>VPN Optimization (we Transfer only needed Data)</li>
				<li>Realtime functions for inform Client for updates</li>
				<li>MEF for a modulbased development and extensibilitiy</li>
				<li>Only using Standard Projects or open source Projects to do main Goals (ex.: MS SQL / MS Reporting Services, ...)</li>
